## Tracing the easy way
### Step 1 - Place the image you want to trace
* File -> Place
* Select the image you want
* Put it on a new layer and lock it to prevent accidently adding lines to it

### Step 2 - Trace with the Blob Brush Tool
Very easy way to Trace is to use the "Blob Brush tool"
* Smooths the curves if you have a shakey hand
* Use the [ and ] keys to increase and decrease the Brush size
* So much easier than the path tool!
