# Long vs Short Selling
* Long on an investment, it means that you have bought a stock hoping its price will *RISE* in the future. 
* Short: you are hoping for a *FALL* in share price.

## How Short Selling works
* You borrow the share you want to sell
* Then sell the share at a certain price
* You hope the price will go down because..
* You now NEED to buy the exact same number of shares you sold for the current price
* You give these back to the lender to cover the cost of you selling that stock
* If the price was lower than the ones you borrowed then the lender will give you the difference!
* 

So if you paid $10 to sell a stock (from a lender) and then the price went down to $9, you buy them for $9, give them back to the lender and they pay you back the $10 and you keep the $1 profit, you know have $11.
